# Where to go from here

I hope that this little book was useful and that you would like to learn
more on reproducible research and bioinformatics. The three things that I
believe are most useful to almost any researcher are:

 * Statistics
 * Coding (likely R or Python)
 * Reproducible workflows with Quarto/Rmarkdown or Jupyter

Even if you are not going to use these tools yourself, gaining an insight
into how they work will help you to communicate with your bioinformatician.

**Statistics.** 

**Coding**. Popular language choices include Python and R; Python is more
widely spread among computer scientists, but has a slightly steeper
learning curve. If you plan to code a lot, Python will be a good choice. R,
on the other hand, is ideal for the casual data scientist. The R language
is particularly well suited for both data science and statistics.

**Quarto / Rmarkdown**. Rmarkdown is the R-only, older system, while Quarto
is the modern variant which supports R, Python and other languages. Both
are excellent tools for creating reproducible workflows. They are easy to
learn (especially if you are using Rstudio) and allow a lot of flexibility
in the produced output. In fact, this book that you are reading right now
has been written in Quarto.
