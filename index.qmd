# Introduction

Please note: this brochure is a work in progress, barely started at this stage.
The statistics chapter is largely ready, but others are at various stages.
However, there still is the presentation ([https://bihealth.github.io/howtotalk](https://bihealth.github.io/howtotalk))
which is actually where my idea started.

## Who this book is for

## Who am I to tell you this stuff?

## Bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology

We often refer to the whole general category of humans involved in
biological data analysis using computers as "bioinformaticians". However,
strictly speaking, bioinformaticians in the proper sense of the word are
those who develop algorithms, databases and software packages. Then, there
are those who use these tools to actual data, and the more precise term for
these people is "computational biologists". Finally, there are those of us
who walk around and criticize experimental designs and they are called
statisticians.
